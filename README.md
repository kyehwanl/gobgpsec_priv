# NIST GoBGPsec 
GoBGPsec uses NIST SRxCrypto library to facilitate crypto calculations
which is able to sign and verify X.509 objects for BGPSec path validation. 


## Project Status

Active development




## Getting Started

You need a working Go Environment 

* go version > 1.13 
* protoc version == 3.7.1


### Prerequisites

Need to install SRxCryptoAPI library first. GoBGPsec requires to use this crypto library
for signing and validation when the BGPSec operation starts. <br>
Need SRxCryptoAPI library >= v3.0

Download NIST SRx software from the link below. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST-BGP-SRx.git
```

And then build with buildBGP-SRx.sh script.
It will install automatically all the packages.
```bash
./buildBGP-SRx.sh
```
or you might install individual modules, for example, only install SRxCryptoAPI library with
following command.
```
cd srx-crypto-api
./configure --prefix=<Dir/to/install> CFLAGS="-O0 -g"
```


### Build 
To import NIST SRxCryptoAPI library, need to specify the library location with a build or
install command. Otherwise LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable might be used.
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib go build [source|./...]                    
go build ./...
```
Or 
```
go build -ldflags="-r /path/to/lib/go_srx_test" ./...
```


Avoiding the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Shared Libs in Go (cgo) Applications   
```
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/path/to/lib"
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I/path/to/include/"
go build ./...
```


### Install
Install binaries into $GOPATH/bin. Simply use 'install' instead of 'build' in commands
```
go install ./...
```
